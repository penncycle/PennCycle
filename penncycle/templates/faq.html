For a $10 fee, a registration process, and a swipe of PennCard, you can have full access to bikes (including locks and helmets). After you have registered, visit Hill College House and present your PennCard to a PennCycle Associate at the desk. Take the numbered key and find the corresponding PennCycle. Inspect the bike and report issues, adjust the seat, and PennCycle! Remember to return the bike to Hill College House before 7 PM!
