<h2>University Bicycle Policy</h2>

<p margin-left:0in'>
NOTE: On public streets
and campus paths, bicycles are vehicles and must comply with traffic laws.
Cyclists and pedestrians share common University paths. To prevent injuries,
common sense and courtesy are key. Bicycles must yield the right-of-way to
pedestrians. Pedestrian traffic is especially heavy on Locust Walk. As a
result, the University has instituted the following policy: Between 8:30 am and
5:30 pm, Monday - Friday, bike riding is prohibited on the following walkways:
Locust Walk, Hamilton Walk and Smith Walk. Bicyclists are required to walk
their bicycles over the Locust Walk footbridge.</p>
