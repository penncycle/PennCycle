WLS
 runs on JVM deployed on Host
WLS resources are 
a) jdbc connection pool (active connections)
b) JMS Queues (look up from the excel spreadsheet)

JVM 
Heap usage (heap after gc)

Host
a) CPU
b) host memory


Usage:
Insights into capacity utilization of resources to determine time periods of under utilization, (over) resource constraints

Determine requirements for moving from on-prem deployment to private cloud
