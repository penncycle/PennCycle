    Hey %s, 
    
    I'm a robot working for PennCycle. Looks like you didn't check in your bike today. That's not a problem: feel free to keep it out as long as you like! 
    We do charge a $5 overnight fee every evening, which you can pay by cash, credit, check, or bursar. 
    You won't be able to check out bikes while you have fees outstanding: reply to this email to arrange payment, or with any questions.

    Thanks, 

    P-98-C22
    Robot, PennCycle
