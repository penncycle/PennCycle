Current:
Fixed nesting on FAQ

Moved into pcout:
settigs_old.py
b001.dump
url.txt
src and its pip-delete-this-directory
admin_styles.css (body {background-color:red})
various ~ files

Possible/stylistic:
"Save 20% on Unlimited single-day checkouts for the entire academic year."
to "Save 20% on unlimited checkouts for the entire academic year."
Same for "Unlimited single-day checkouts for the fall semester."
"Unlimited single-day" is strange
Use a regular or at least standard font--the i's look weird and the fonts have to load

Planned:
Fixing relative links

Could use a look:
payment.js
